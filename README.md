## 🌍 The Problem: The Hidden Burnout Epidemic
In Africa's fast-growing tech and professional hubs, "hustle culture" often masks a serious mental health crisis. Burnout is frequently ignored until it results in severe clinical exhaustion. **Mindset Pulse** uses Kotlin Multiplatform to deliver an accessible, low-friction tool that acts as a mental health "check-engine" light.

## 🚀 Key Features
*   **AI-Curated Daily Check-ins:** Gemini AI dynamically generates empathetic questions based on stress, sleep, and workload.
*   **Responsible AI Engine:** Text responses are analyzed by Gemini for sentiment, but the final **Risk Score (0-100)** is calculated by a transparent, shared KMP Risk Engine.
*   **Relaxation Rhythms:** A cross-platform audio player for focus and mindfulness, featuring an industry-standard floating mini-player.
*   **Safe Spaces:** Real-time community hubs for peer support, moderated by AI to ensure a supportive atmosphere.
*   **Gamified Growth:** 20 levels of "Mindset Progression" (from Initiate to Pulse Master) to reward consistent mental health maintenance.
*   **Responsive Master-Detail UI:** A high-performance web dashboard layout that adapts seamlessly to mobile devices.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture
Mindset Pulse is built using **Clean Architecture** to ensure maximum code reuse (90%+) across Android and Web.

### Shared Logic (`:composeApp:commonMain`)
*   **Domain Layer:** Rule-based `RiskEngine` and `TrendAnalyzer` written in pure Kotlin.
*   **Data Layer:** Cloud-first approach using `GitLive Firebase KMP` for Firestore, Auth, and Storage.
*   **Service Layer:** `GeminiService` using Ktor for high-speed, structured AI analysis.
*   **Presentation Layer:** Shared `MVVM` using Moko ViewModels to drive identical UI state on all platforms.
